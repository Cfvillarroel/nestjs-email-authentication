# Nestjs email authentication
This project is an example of implementation of a user **email authentication** with [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [PassportJs](http://www.passportjs.org)

It can be used as base of a nestjs project: it implements API for login/registration of a user in a database and features of **email verification**, **forgotten password** and **reset password**.

# Getting started
Install `nodejs` and `mongodb` in your machine.

Install dependencies with npm and run the application:
``` 
npm install
npm run start
```

# Configuration File
 You can find a `config.ts` file in the root of the project. Before run the server you have to set :email: [Nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) options to be able to send emails:
```
"host": {
    "url": "<server-url>", //It is needed to redirect user to your server from received email
    "port": "3000"
},
...
"mail":{ 
    "host": "<smtp-host>", //Nodemailer settings (go to the nodemailer documentation for further informations)
    "port": "<port>",
    "secure": false,
    "user": "<username>",
    "pass": "<password>"
}
```

# API
Server will listen on port `3000`, and it expose the following APIs:


- **POST** - `/auth/email/register` - Login user
  - **email** - *string*
  - **password** - *string*
  - **name** - *string (optional)*
  - **surname** - *string (optional)*

- **POST** - `/auth/email/login` - Register a new user
  - **email** - *string*
  - **password** - *string*

- **GET** - `auth/email/verify/:token` - Activate user account from token sent in the mail

- **GET** - `/auth/email/resend-verification/:email` - Resend verification email with token to user 

- **GET** - `/auth/email/forgot-password/:email` - Send email with token for rest password 

- **POST** - `/auth/email/reset-password` - Change user password
  - **newPassword** - *string*
  - **newPasswordToken** - *string (token received from forgot-password api)*

- **GET** - `/auth/users` - Returns all users (must be logged in)

- **GET** - `/auth/users/user/:email` - Returns selected user info (must be logged in)

# Passport JWT strategy
This project use JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-jwt)) Bearer Token as authentication strategy for Passport. 
The login API returns an access_token that you have to use to send a correct authorization header in calls that require authentication. You can find an example with postman [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization)

Login response:
```
{
   ...
  "data": {
      "token": {
          "expires_in": "3600",
          "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...._DkYJJh4s"
      },
  ...
}
```

Authorization header example:
```
 Authorization â†’ Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...._DkYJJh4s
```
